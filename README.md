**Real-time transit tracking for Rome's public transport system**  
*Nnamo Inc.*

Track buses, view live arrivals, and navigate Rome's transit network with real-time GTFS data from Roma Mobilit√†.

## What it does

Moovite connects to Rome's live transit feeds to show you:
- Where buses are right now on the map
- When your bus will actually arrive (not just the schedule)
- Route paths with live vehicle positions
- System-wide statistics and performance metrics

The app processes GTFS (General Transit Feed Specification) data every 30 seconds to keep everything current.

## Main features

<img src="src/main/resources/images/panels/search_small.png" align="left" width="24"/> **Search** - Find stops and routes by name. The search is fuzzy, so typing "termini" will find "Roma Termini" and similar stops.

<img src="src/main/resources/images/panels/sidebar_stop_small.png" align="left" width="24"/> **Stop details** - Click any stop to see live departure times, delays, and which routes pass through it.

<img src="src/main/resources/images/panels/favorite_small.png" align="left" width="24"/> **Favorites** - Save stops you use regularly. They'll show up on the favorites menu for quick access.

<img src="src/main/resources/images/panels/statistics_small.png" align="left" width="24"/> **Statistics** - System-wide metrics like how many buses are currently stopped, delayed, or running smoothly.

git clone https://github.com/nnamo-inc/moovite.git
cd moovite
make compile
make run
```

## How to use it

1. **Search**: Type a stop name or route number in the search bar
2. **Select**: Click on a stop to see live departure times  
3. **Explore**: Click on routes to see the full path with live buses
4. **Track**: Watch vehicles move in real-time on the interactive map
5. **Analyze**: Check the statistics panel for system performance

The interface shows delays in red when buses are late, and quality indicators help you choose the best routes.

## Technical details

Built with Java 21, using:
- **SQLite** for local GTFS data storage
- **GTFS Protocol Buffers** for real-time feed processing
- **Swing + FlatLaf** for the interface
- **JXMapViewer** for the interactive map
- **ORMLite** for database operations

The app continuously processes updates with live vehicle positions and trip updates.
